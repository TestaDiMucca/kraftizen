# Kraftizen

A bunch of dumb-as-rocks Minecraft bots to boss around and get into trouble.

[API Reference](https://prismarinejs.github.io/mineflayer/#/api)
[Bot examples](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/tree/master/examples)

Inspired by all the posts of "I have my two-week Minecraft phase right now but nobody wants to join me or I have no friends"

Project is in the hacking early stages, excuse the bad stuff.
